# Yoshiplex-Minecraft-Server-Main-Plugin
The main code for my old minecraft server made when I was 13 and 14.

Since some of it was made when I didn't know what I was doing, and some of it was made when I sort of knew what I was doing, it has no documentation, pretty good formatting, and is a lot of code to go through.

This is probably one of my biggest projects because I kept adding to it. As of right now, the Minecraft Server that the code was running on no longer exists. Maybe one day, this code will go to use.

The code has basic stuff that a MC server would need plus a few custom games like Mario Kart, Slither.io, Guitar Hero, and Agar.io. 

This github page is just a place to store all of the code for the project/plugin.
