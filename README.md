# Yoshiplex-Minecraft-Server-Main-Plugin
The main code for my old minecraft server made when I was 13 and 14.

Since some of it was made when I didn't know what I was doing, and some of it was made when I sort of knew what I was doing, it has no documentation, pretty good formatting, and is a lot of code to go through.

This is probably one of my biggest projects because I kept adding to it. As of right now, the Minecraft Server that the code was running on no longer exists. Maybe one day, this code will go to use.
